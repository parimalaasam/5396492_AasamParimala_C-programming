ðŸ“œ C Programming Certificate â€“ SoloLearn
I successfully completed the C Programming course on SoloLearn, where I gained a strong foundation in the following topics:
Basic Concepts of C
Conditionals and Loops
Arrays and Strings
Functions and Pointers
The course provided clear and understandable explanations, and the interactive Knowledge Checks were especially helpful in reinforcing the concepts.
